### SNHU Analysis Document (HTML)

The __SNHU Analysis Document__ is meant to structure an analysis around a question.  The business often has a question that we have to address. 

+ __Overview__ meant to provide facts about the question. 
+ __Context__ meant to answer why it is like that. 
+ __Recommendation__, if needed, is meant to serve as next steps.

### SNHU ReMap Testing Document (HTML)

__ReMap__ is responsible for a lot of experiments.  The __SNHU ReMap Testing Document__  is meant to serve a stricter guide on constructing a successful experiment.  

+ The __Overview__ section should be filled before you run the experiment and has the __Idea/Theory__ and the structure __Hypothesis__ for the test.  
+ The __Test Design__ section should also be fill out before you run your experiment, it should also have what metric you are trying to influence and how you are going to set up the test (e.g. who will be in the control, how long...).  
+ Lastly, the __Outcomes & Learnings__ section is the result of the test and what the next steps are (e.g. expand, refine, or kill).
